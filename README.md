# movieDatabase
A small React app to show trending movies using the Movie Database (TMDB) API.

After clone-ing the project & npm install in the terminal, the .env file must be added outside the src folder, with the API KEY. 
!!! VITE needs the api key to start as following:
 
 VITE_MOVIE_API_KEY = 'apikey'
 
 Then you can do the: npm run dev in the terminal and browse the project :)
